1. “Parental alienation refers to a family dynamic in which a child aligns with one parent (the alienating parent) and rejects their other parent (the targeted, or alienated parent) for reasons that are not legitimate (Harman et al., 2021)” ([Harman et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QTH6VRUY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWXQD47X?page=2&annotation=X3VQMSUD)) 
2. ”[Parental alienation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parental-alienation "Psychology Today looks at Parental alienation") is a set of strategies that parents use to undermine and interfere with a child's relationship with his or her other parent.” 
3. “Parental alienation, which most commonly occurs in the context of child custody disputes during and after parental separation, involves the “programming” of a child by one parent to denigrate the other “target” parent, in an effort to harm, damage, and destroy the relationship between a child and the target parent, whereby the target parent is demonized and undermined as a parent worthy of the child’s love and attention (Harman, Kruk, & Hines, In Press).” ([Kruk, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/SUXZJMSP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PQKNAV?page=2&annotation=VGPXEDFQ))

- [[8 manifestations in alienated kids]]
These are the symptoms of parental alienation that appear within [[alienated children]]. Generally, the more symptoms present and the more severe the symptoms, the more severe the alienation; **all manifestations do not need to be present in order for alienation to exist**.^[1]

1. **[[Campaign of denigration]]**: Strong or utter rejection of one parent, willingness to tell others,erasing past positive aspects of relationship and memories.

2. **[[Weak, frivolous, absurd reasons for the rejection]]**: When pressed to explain the rejection will give reasons that do not make sense or explain the level of animosity, are [[false memories]] (proclaiming to remember something from a very young age), or are patently untrue.

3. **[[Lack of ambivalence]]**: For the most part, one parent is seen as all good while the other is viewed as all bad.

4. **[[“Independent thinker” phenomenon]]**: The child strongly emphasizes that the favored parent played no role in the child’s rejection of the other parent.

5. **[[Reflexive support of the alienating parent in the parental conflict]]**: Almost always taking the favored parent’s side in almost all disagreements.

6. **[[Absence of guilt]]**: Appearing to have no qualms about cruel and harsh treatment of the rejected parent.

7. **[[The presence of borrowed scenarios]]**: Use of words and phrases that mimic or parrot those of the favored parent.

8. **[[Rejection of extended family of rejected parent]]**: Refusal to spend time with or acknowledge formerly beloved family members.
